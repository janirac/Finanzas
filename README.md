# Finanzas

## Background

Finanzas is an interactive budget visualization app that takes ancient budgeting to modernistic budgeting/financial goal setting. The app takes a user's income, savings, financial goals, and transactions to generate graphical projections on the accomplishment/failures of the goals considering userâ€™s current location inflation rate. It creates an interactive experience with graphs and drags boxes that dynamically decrement or increment the balance. The graphs will change by color or size depending on the user's input.
